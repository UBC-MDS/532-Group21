# Proposal

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Development aid agencies (Not-for-profits, charities, etc.) 

Development aid agencies are varied in size, missions, expertise, and experience. Some have a very targeted mission, choosing to focus on specific regions or development issues.  While others have a broader scope, operating in many locations and development areas.  Some have the resources to do extensive research and hire experts in their chosen area of focus, but many do not.   We propose building a data visualization app to assist these organizations visually explore some key statistics for developing countries/regions.  This will help them identify countries/regions that would benefit from the type of services they provide or provide some additional insight into a region where they already operate.  While also perhaps challenging some of their preconceived ideas about a particular region.   Our app will provide these organizations a snapshot of several key development statistics, as well as several demographic statistics.  Users can then explore the statistics by filtering on areas of their specific interest.
