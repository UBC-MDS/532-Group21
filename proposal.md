# Proposal

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Development aid agencies (Not-for-profits, charities, etc.) 

Development aid agencies are varied in size, missions, expertise, and experience. Some have a very targeted mission, choosing to focus on specific regions or development issues.  While others have a broader scope, operating in many locations and development areas.  Some have the resources to do extensive research and hire experts in their chosen area of focus, but many do not.   We propose building a data visualization app to assist these organizations visually explore some key statistics for developing countries/regions.  This will help them identify countries/regions that would benefit from the type of services they provide or provide some additional insight into a region where they already operate.  While also perhaps challenging some of their preconceived ideas about a particular region.   Our app will provide these organizations a snapshot of several key development statistics, as well as several demographic statistics.  Users can then explore the statistics by filtering on areas of their specific interest.  

## Description of the data

We will be visualizing country data from the summarized Gapminder dataset which has 14 columns containing various demographic data for each country from the year 1800, although data from the earlier years is often missing. The majority of our dashboard will focus on  the more current data and thus much of the historical data will not be used. Each country has has an associated region and sub_region which will be used mostly as filters. The health related indicators such as life_expectancy and child_mortality (deaths of children under 5 per 1,00 live births) of countries will be showcased alongside the economic level (GDP per capita, inflation adjusted) of countries to see how these variables are associated with one another. Furthermore, we will use the education level of each country represented by years_in_school for men and women to see any significant differences as well as population density and carbon dioxide emissions in tonnes per capita.
