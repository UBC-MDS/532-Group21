## Description of app and sketch
The app has a single main page with three visualizations that depend on the filters selected. Most importantly, the top left contains a filter which selects the statistic of interest and this is the main filter on which all of the visuals are built and includes life expectancy, child mortality, education ratio and population density. At the top of the page is a global map which displays a color gradient corresponding to the level of the chosen statistic of interest for each country. A filter can be applied for region, sub region and income group and only the countries contained in those filters will be colored on the map. Furthermore, there is a also a slider which can control the minimum and maximum population size for these countries. These filters also apply to the two bottom plots. The bottom left chart is a horizontal bar chart showing the statistic of interest for the top 5 or bottom 5 countries (controlled via a button switch) in the filtered group to allow for a closer look at the data. The bottom right chart displays the statistic of interest over time in a line plot (top 5 or bottom 5) and also has an additional filter for the date range for users to see how the data in those specific countries trended over time.
